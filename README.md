I wanted to make something modern, clean, and eye-catching — something that feels alive. I opened my code editor, wrote basic HTML structure, and step by step added styles using CSS.

This project may look simple, but it taught me a very important lesson:
"You don’t need complex tools to start. You just need to start."
When I saw the final result on my screen, it made me smile. It gave me confidence that yes, I can do this. As a developer, our journey is made up of small steps like this — and every step matters.

I have uploaded this project to GitHub. It’s open source and free for everyone to explore, learn, and use.
